# Population Visualization Program
This Python program uses the Matplotlib library to create population visualizations based on user preferences. It provides three main options for visualizing population data. The program reads data from a CSV file and generates the following visualizations:

# Options:
1. Country Population Growth Graph:

* The program starts by asking the user to select a continent.
* Then, it prompts the user to choose a specific country within the selected continent.
* The result is a bar graph displaying the population growth of the selected country over time.

2. Global Population Growth Bar Chart:

* This option generates a bar chart illustrating the overall population growth of the entire planet.

3. Population Distribution Pie Chart:

* This option creates a pie chart comparing the percentage population distribution among different regions or countries.

# Requirements:
To run this program, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

* Matplotlib
* CSV

# How to Use:
1. Clone this repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed ('matplotlib' and 'csv'). You can install them using pip:
```pip install matplotlib```
3. Prepare your population data in a CSV file, ensuring it contains information about countries, continents, and population figures.
4. Run the Python script and follow the on-screen prompts to select the visualization option and provide the necessary input.

Feel free to customize the program to use your own population dataset or modify the visualization options to suit your needs. Enjoy exploring population data visually!
